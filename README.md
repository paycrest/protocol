## Paycrest Aggregator

The aggregator works to simplify and automate how liquidity flows between various provision nodes and user-created orders.


## Protocol Architecture

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdea36e5-9f54-4b17-bf0d-44d33d96fc62)

**Create Order**: The user creates an on/off ramp order (read Payment Intent) on the Gateway Smart Contract (escrow) through an onchain app built on the protocol like [Zap by Paycrest](https://github.com/paycrest/zap) or through our [Sender API](https://app.paycrest.io/).

**Aggregate**: The aggregator node indexes the order and assigns it to one or more provision nodes run by liquidity providers.

**Fulfill**: The provisioning node automatically disburses funds to their wallet or recipient's local bank account, mobile money wallet via connections to payment service providers (PSP).

## Development Setup

Pre-requisite: Install required dependencies:
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Ent](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started/) for database ORM
- [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/guides/evaluation/install#install-atlas-locally) for database migrations

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Setup the aggregator repo on your local machine.

```bash

# clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/paycrest/aggregator.git

cd aggregator

# copy enviroment variables

cp .env.example .env
```

2. Start and seed the development environment:
```bash

# build the image
docker-compose build

# run containers
docker-compose up -d

# make script executable
chmod +x scripts/import_db.sh

# run the script to seed db with sample configured sender & provider profile
./scripts/import_db.sh
```

3. Run our sandbox provision node and connect it to your local aggregator by following the [instructions here](https://paycrest.notion.site/run-sandbox-provision-node)

Here, we’d make use of a demo provision node and connect it to our local aggregator

That's it! The server will now be running at http://localhost:8000. You can use an API testing tool like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.


## Usage
- Try a decentralized offramp on [Zap by Paycrest](https://zap.paycrest.io)
- [Swagger REST API Specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/paycrest-dev/paycrest-api/0.1.0)
- Interact with the Sender API using the sandbox API Key `11f93de0-d304-4498-8b7b-6cecbc5b2dd8`
 - Payment orders that are initiated using the Sender API in sandbox should use the following testnet tokens from the public faucets of their respective networks:
	 - **DAI** on Base Sepolia
	 - **USDT** on Ethereum Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia

## Testing

We use a combination of unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the codebase.

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
# install and run ganache local blockchain
npm install ganache --global
HD_WALLET_MNEMONIC="media nerve fog identify typical physical aspect doll bar fossil frost because"; ganache -m "$HD_WALLET_MNEMONIC" --chain.chainId 1337 -l 21000000

# run all tests
go test ./...

# run a specific test
go test ./path/to/test/file
```
It is mandatory that you write tests for any new features or changes you make to the codebase. Only PRs that include passing tests will be accepted.
